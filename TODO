Before v1.0:
-----------

- find a way to support passing a WAV file without the file suffix (i.e.,
  msndfile.read('some_file')). Ideas so far:
  - find all files starting with 'some_file' and print an error if there is no
    WAV file amongst them
- find out what those Valgrind warnings for lines 202 and 205 in
  src/+msndfile/blockread.c are about

General:
--------

- maybe add support for "fmt" option to blockread
- implement msndwrite
- implement msndblockwrite
