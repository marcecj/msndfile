Before v1.0:
-----------

- find out what those Valgrind warnings for lines 202 and 205 in
  src/+msndfile/blockread.c are about

Before v1.1:
------------

- implement msndwrite

Before v1.2:
------------

- implement msndblockwrite

Misc:
-----

- maybe add support for "fmt" option to blockread
- add "seek" command to blockread
- improve error handling and messages (e.g., prefix libsndfile errors with "libsndfile: ")
    - maybe support internationalization? might be difficult to port, though
    - return error codes and handle all errors in the main functions?

Someday (maybe):
----------------

- support leaving out the file extension for non-simple formats
