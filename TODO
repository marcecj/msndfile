Before v1.1:
------------

- implement msndwrite

Before v1.2:
------------

- implement msndblockwrite

Misc:
-----

- test suite: don't fail when a format is not supported, just print a message
  (see https://github.com/marcecj/msndfile/issues/1).
- support relative seeking?
- document "no transpose" feature of blockread
- pick a license for the documentation
- merge linkedlists branch
- move gen_filename() and friends to read_utils.c
- change license to LGPL (like libsndfile)
- maybe add support for "fmt" option to blockread
- improve error handling and messages (e.g., prefix libsndfile errors with "libsndfile: ")
    - maybe support internationalization? might be difficult to port, though
    - return error codes and handle all errors in the main functions?

Someday (maybe):
----------------

- support leaving out the file extension for non-simple formats
