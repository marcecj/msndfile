Change history of msndfile
==========================

This document records the changes made in each release of msndfile, and in all
release candidates.  For the full list of changes, see the git log.

Version 1.0
-----------

This is the first release of msndfile. It supports all functionality of wavread,
and an almost feature complete function for block-wise reading.

Changes since 1.0RC3:
- completely re-structure the documentation
  - The README was split up and moved to the doc/ subdirectory, along with the
    INSTALL file. The result (after various edits) are a proper AsciiDoc based
    website and PDF manual.
  - A much smaller README file is now written in markdown (for Github).
- a small fix to the blockread help text
- various small changes and bug fixes
- various fixes and improvements to the test suite
- various improvements to the build system, including a new AsciiDoc tool
  (written by me)

- msndfile.blockread() now supports the commands "seek" and "tell".
- return an empty matrix when no samples can be read

  reached, e.g, due to malloc() errors).
