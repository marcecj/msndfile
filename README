The msndfile Mex extension
==========================
Marc Joliet <marc.joliet@stud.fh-oldenburg.de>

Introduction
------------

msndfile is a Matlab Mex wrapper of the libsndfile C library for reading audio
files.  It returns the audio files as MxN arrays, M being the number of samples
per channel and N being the number of channels, as returned by, e.g.,
'wavread()'.  The one major feature still missing is support for writing audio
files, which should be relatively simple, though.

Installation
------------

See the file `INSTALL`.
