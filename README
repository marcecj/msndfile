The msndfile Mex extension
==========================
Marc Joliet <marc.joliet@stud.fh-oldenburg.de>

Introduction
------------

msndfile is a mex wrapper for the libsndfile C library for reading audio files.
It returns the audio files as MxN arrays, M being the number of samples per
channel and N being the number of channels, as returned by, e.g., 'wavread()'.
The only thing it doesn't do is write audio files, which should be relatively
simple, though.

Installation
------------

See the file `INSTALL`.
