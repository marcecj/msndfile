The msndfile Mex extension
==========================
Marc Joliet <marcec@gmx.de>

msndfile is a suite of MATLAB Mex wrappers of the
http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile[libsndfile] C library for reading and
writing audio files.

Introduction
------------

The MATLAB built-in functions for reading and writing WAV files (i.e., `wavread`
and `wavwrite`) have their limitations.  They do not support files larger than 4
GB, and do not support certain non-Microsoft WAV formats (e.g., RF64, Broadcast
WAV).  This leads to users editing `wavread` to support whatever formats they
need to use.  This project, msndfile, aims to provide `wavread` and `wavwrite`
compatible functions that uses the
http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile[libsndfile] C library.  This also means that
msndfile supports http://www.vorbis.com/[OGG Vorbis] and (in my opinion much
more interesting) the Free Lossless Audio Codec
http://flac.sourceforge.net[FLAC].

Currently, the suite consists of two functions: `msndread` and `msndblockread`.
The latter is intended solely for reading audio files block-wise, for instance
to process large files that don't fit in RAM.  Still missing are the
corresponding functions for writing data: `msndwrite` and `msndblockwrite`.
Just as with `msndread`, `msndwrite` is supposed to be API-compatible with
`wavwrite`.

Features
--------

The msndfile suite currently has the following features:

- Can read any file type supported by libsndfile, such as FLAC and OGG Vorbis,
  but also various WAV formats not supported by the `wavread` function, e.g.
  Riff64 (RF64) and Broadcast WAV, and has no (known) file size limit.
- Can read multiple files in a block-wise manner via the function
  `msndblockread`.
- It is in general more efficient (read: faster) than pure-MATLAB code, except
  under special circumstances which favour the JIT compiler footnote:[The one
  example I can think of is a pure-MATLAB function for block-wise reading of WAV
  files that becomes *extremely* fast when reading the same range of samples
  repeatedly.].

Compatibility with `wavread`
----------------------------

Msndfile may differ in behaviour a bit if a file is not a WAV file.  In these
cases, the following differences to `wavread` hold:

- The opts.fmt struct has no "wFormatTag" field if the file type is not a WAV
  file (which is completely logical).
- The opts.info struct may contain fields unique to non-WAV formats.
