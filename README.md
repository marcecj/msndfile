# The msndfile Mex extension

## Introduction

msndfile is a suite of MATLAB Mex wrappers of the
[libsndfile](http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile) C library for reading and
writing audio files.  Currently, it consists of of two functions:
`msndfile.read` and `msndfile.blockread`.  The former is intended as an API
compatible replacement for `wavread()`, latter is intended for reading audio
files block-wise, for instance to process large files that don't fit in RAM.

Due to the use of [libsndfile](http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile), msndfile
supports more formats than `wavread`, such as various WAV version not supported by
`wavread` (e.g., ADPCM, Âµ-law and A-law), [OGG Vorbis](http://www.vorbis.com/)
and (in my opinion much more interesting) the Free Lossless Audio Codec
[FLAC](http://flac.sourceforge.net).

Still missing are the corresponding functions for writing data: `msndfile.write`
and `msndfile.blockwrite`.  Just as with `msndfile.read`, `msndfile.write` is
supposed to be API-compatible with `wavwrite`.

## Installation from source

There are two ways to compile msndfile.  The easy way, in Matlab, is to type
`compile_msndfile` to compile all Mex extensions.  The resulting package
directory `+msndfile` should be copied to a location in MATLABs path.

There is also a more flexible build system based on SCons that can also generate
a Visual Studio IDE project file and can be integrated into other IDEs like
Eclipse.  This build system is explained in more detail in the full
documentation on the [project homepage](http://msndfile.sf.net) (or in the `doc`
directory in the source repository).
