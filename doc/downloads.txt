The most recent version of msndfile is 1.1.1. You can download the source
package, binary packages (for whatever platforms are available to me), and a
PDF version of this website
https://github.com/marcecj/msndfile/releases/tag/v1.1.1[here].

The Windows binary packages bundle the libsndfile DLL.  Under Linux and Mac it
is expected that libsndfile is already installed (e.g., via a package manager).
