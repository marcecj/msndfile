The most recent version of msndfile is 1.1. You can download the source
package, binaries (32 bit Windows, 32 bit and 64 bit Linux) and a PDF version
of this website https://github.com/marcecj/msndfile/releases/tag/v1.1[here].
The 32 bit binaries were compiled using MATLAB 2010a Student Edition, the
64 bit Linux binaries using 2013a Student Edition.

The Windows binaries bundle the libsndfile DLL.  Under Linux and Mac it is
expected that libsndfile is already installed (e.g., via a package manager).
