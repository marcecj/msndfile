Introduction

The MATLAB built-in functions for reading and writing WAV files (i.e., `wavread`
and `wavwrite`) have their limitations.  They do not support files larger than 4
GB, and do not support certain non-Microsoft WAV formats (e.g., RF64).  This
leads to users editing `wavread` to support whatever formats they need to use.
This project, msndfile, aims to provide `wavread` and `wavwrite` compatible
functions using the http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile[libsndfile] C library.
This also means that msndfile supports http://www.vorbis.com/[OGG Vorbis] and
(in my opinion much more interesting) the Free Lossless Audio Codec
http://flac.sourceforge.net[FLAC].

Currently, the suite consists of two functions: `msndfile.read` and
`msndfile.blockread`.  The latter is intended solely for reading audio files
block-wise, for instance to process large files that don't fit in RAM.  Still
missing are the corresponding functions for writing data: `msndfile.write` and
`msndfile.blockwrite`.  Just as with `msndfile.read`, `msndfile.write` is
supposed to be API-compatible with `wavwrite`.
