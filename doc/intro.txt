Introduction

The MATLAB built-in functions for reading and writing WAV files (i.e., `wavread`
and `wavwrite`) have their limitations.  They do not support files larger than 4
GB, and do not support certain non-Microsoft WAV formats (e.g., RF64).  This
leads to users editing `wavread` to support whatever formats they need to use.
This project, msndfile, aims to provide `wavread` and `wavwrite` compatible
functions using the {libsndfile} C library, which supports various formats,
including many WAV variants, and has a track record of robustness footnote:[I
received informal feedback from one user who had WAV files that `wavread()`
had trouble reading, but which libsndfile handled fine.].  This also means
that msndfile supports {vorbis} and (in my opinion much more interesting) the
Free Lossless Audio Codec {flac}.

Currently, the suite consists of two functions: `msndfile.read` and
`msndfile.blockread`.  The latter is intended solely for reading audio files
block-wise, for instance to process large files that do not fit in RAM.  Still
missing are the corresponding functions for writing data: `msndfile.write` and
`msndfile.blockwrite`.  Just as with `msndfile.read`, `msndfile.write` is
supposed to be API-compatible with `wavwrite`.
