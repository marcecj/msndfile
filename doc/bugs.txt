Bugs, feature requests & patches
--------------------------------

Bugs and features should ideally be reported/requested on the {githubpage}
(using the issue tracker) or via {email}.  Patches should ideally be handled
via pull requests (either via the {githubpage} or by email), but I will also
accept patches sent via email.
