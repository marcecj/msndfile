Compatibility with `wavread`
----------------------------

While the goal of `msndfile.read` is to be API-compatible with `wavread`,
there are special cases where this cannot be (completely) achieved.  These are
detailed in the following sections.

Leaving off the file type extension
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While `msndfile` supports reading files without the file type extension, i.e.

---------------------------
>> msndfile.read('some_file');
---------------------------

works, the following conditions must be met:

- There may be no ambiguity with regards to which file is meant, unless one of
  the files with the same basename is a WAV file.  For example: if you try to
  read `some_file` and there are two files, `some_file.aiff` and `some_file.flac`,
  msndfile will abort with an error.  However, if there is also a file
  `some_file.wav`, msndfile will read that.
- The format must be what the libsndfile documentation refers to as ``simple''.
  These ``simple formats'' are: AIF{F,C}, AU, CAF, FLAC, VOX, Ogg and WAV.
  Additionaly, RAW files are supported, even though RAW is not a ``simple format''.

For other, more ``exotic'' file types, it is therefor necessary to provide the
file type extension.

Differences when the file is not a WAV file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Msndfile may differ in behaviour a bit if a file is not a WAV file.  In these
cases, the following differences to `wavread` hold:

- The opts.fmt struct has no ``wFormatTag'' field if the file type is not a WAV
  file (which is completely logical).
- Broadcast WAV files produce an additional opts.bext field.
- The opts.info struct may contain fields unique to non-WAV formats.

Warnings and errors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Msndfile will of course have its own unique warnings and errors, but might also
print different warnings and errors in identical situations.  This might be less
of a problem in situations where the error is a system error, in which case it
seems that `wavread` and msndfile both print the system error (i.e.,
`strerror(errno)`).

More importantly, though, the error and warning IDs will be different, since
msndfile uses its own ID component 'msndfile:', as per MATLAB documentation
footnote:[If requested, I could at least make the mnemonics identical to
`wavread`].

Changes in the behaviour of `wavread`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It may be that some `wavread()` behaviour may change over time or may have
changed in the (recent) past.  Msndfile will for simplicity only implement one
type of behaviour.  Here is a list of all known examples:

- In older versions of MATLAB trying to read zero samples will instead read a
  file in its entirety.  Newer versions instead return an empty matrix, which is
  what msndfile does.  Note that some versions of MATLAB (e.g., 2010a) print a
  large warning that the behaviour will change.
