Features
--------

The msndfile suite currently has the following features:

- Can read any file type supported by libsndfile, such as {flac} and {vorbis},
  but also various WAV formats not supported by the `wavread` function, e.g.
  Riff64 (RF64), and has no (known) file size limit.
- Supports BWF metadata (the `bext` chunk).
- Can read multiple files in a block-wise manner via the function
  `msndfile.blockread`.
- It is in general more efficient (read: faster) than pure-MATLAB code, except
  under special circumstances which favour the JIT compiler footnote:[The one
  example I can think of is a pure-MATLAB function for block-wise reading of WAV
  files that becomes *extremely* fast when reading the same range of samples
  repeatedly.].
